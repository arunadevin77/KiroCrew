// Contract under test:
// - a stub apply that PERSISTED but did not go live (200 with applied:false)
//   surfaces an error instead of drawing a live-looking switch
// - a failed server request renders its own error row, never the "none are
//   configured" empty state, which is a claim a failed request cannot make
// - an unsupported platform can still turn an inherited setting OFF; only
//   turning one ON is blocked, so nobody is trapped in a state they cannot exit
// - sharing cannot be enabled while nothing is stubbed (it would do nothing),
//   but can always be disabled
